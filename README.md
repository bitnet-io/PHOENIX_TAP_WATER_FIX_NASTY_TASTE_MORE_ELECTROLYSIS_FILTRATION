# TAP_WATER_ELECTROLYSIS_FILTRATION

RAW WATER MUST PASS THROUGH A FILTER MANY TIMES BEFORE EVEN STARTING AN ELECTROLYSIS PROCESS

TO TRY AND GET AS MUCH OF THE POLLUNATS OR CONSTIUANTS OUT OF THE WATER BEFORE TURING THE WATER THROUGH ELECTRITY 

THE WATER CAN STILL BE NOXIOUS IF ITS JUST PASSED THROUGH ELECTROLYSIS WITHOUT DOING A PRE-PHASE OF PASSING THE LIQUID TRHOUGH A FILTER 


MUST BE MULTI STAGE FILTER AFTER GETTING WATER

WASTE WATER -> electrolysis + filtration -> pre-gray water (repeat flitration + electrosis process -> like a loop process 

the tap water that comes out now goes into another process to refine it further


1.)

electrosysis to capture H and O from anone and cathode into liquid collection 

pass liquid collection through a HEPA filter

collect output from HEPA filter

and run electrosis from the HEPA filter output 


then process that again through more HEPA filter

and repeat this process again

each output from electrosis and passing throgh a HEPA filter should make cleaner water when its collected up from the raw cathone and anone out process of the elctrolsis process into the collection for liquid that will be liquid outputt





probably repeat a few times to further clean the water
