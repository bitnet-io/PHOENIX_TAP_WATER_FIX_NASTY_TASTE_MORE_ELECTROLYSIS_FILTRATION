# PHOENIX_TAP_WATER_FIX_NASTY_TASTE_MORE_ELECTROLYSIS_FILTRATION

MUST BE MULTI STAGE FILTER AFTER GETTING WATER

WASTE WATER -> electrolysis + filtration -> pre-gray water (repeat flitration + electrosis process -> like a loop process 

the tap water that comes out now goes into another process to refine it further


1.)

electrosysis to capture H and O from anone and cathode into liquid collection 

pass liquid collection through a HEPA filter

collect output from HEPA filter

and run electrosys from the HEPA filter output 


then process that again through more HEPA filter

and repeat this process again

each output from electrosys and passing throgh a HEPA filter should make cleaner water when its collected up from the raw cathone and anone out process of the elctrolsys process into the collection for liquid
